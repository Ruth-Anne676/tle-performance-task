<td><b>Temperatures Will Continue to Rise</b></td>
<td>Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.</td>

<td><b>Greenhouse gases</b></td>
<td> Concentrations of the major greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, and N2O, continued to increase in 2019 and 2020.</td>

<td><b>Global heating</b></td>
<td>Despite developing La Niña conditions, global mean temperature in 2020 is on course to be one of the three warmest on record. The past six years, including 2020, are likely to be the six warmest years on record.</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="white">
<td><b>Rising Seas</b></td>
<td>Sea level has increased throughout the altimeter record, but recently sea level has risen at a higher rate due partly to increased melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. Global mean sea level in 2020 was similar to that in 2019 and both are consistent with the long-term trend. A small drop in global sea level in the latter part of 2020 is likely associated with developing La Niña conditions, similar to the temporary drops associated with previous La Niña events</td>

<td><b>Marine Heatwaves.</b></td>
<td>Over 80% of the ocean area experienced at least one marine heatwave in 2020 to date. More of the ocean experienced marine heat waves classified as ‘strong’ (43%) than ‘moderate’ (28%).</td>
